## Task
Let's say we work for a mining company. We need to decide where to drill a new well.

It is required to build a machine learning model to help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit. The possible profits, as well as risks, should be analyzes via bootstrap procedure.

We have the data on oil samples in three regions: each has as many as 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves have also been measured.
