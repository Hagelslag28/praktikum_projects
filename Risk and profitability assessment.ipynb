    "During the project for a mining company, data on oil samples were examined in three regions: in each of 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. The aim of the project was to determine the most favorable region for exploration of reserves. To do this, a linear regression model was built for each region and the RMSE value was measured. Despite the fact that the average values of reserves in regions 1 and 3 were almost one and a half times higher than in region 2, their standard error was almost equal to this very difference. This means that the model for region 2 turned out to be the most accurate.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "As for the profitability of oil production in the regions, on average, one well promises to bring from 30 (region 2) to 40 (regions 1, 3) million rubles. At the same time, the maximum expected profit in region 1 will be more than 3 billion rubles, and about 2.4 billion rubles in regions 2 and 3.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "Finally, using the bootstrap, data on the riskiness of activities were obtained. Two regions promise to be unprofitable (1 and 3), because the number of unprofitable options for selecting deposits is more than the established threshold of 2.5%. The same is evidenced by the confidence interval of 95% (however, the upper quantile of the interval is not very promising and is far from the maximum possible profit).\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "To sum up, development can be carried out, in essence, only in ***region 2***. Firstly, its model was much stronger and more accurate than the others, with a very small RMSE. Secondly, its profitability is quite high, even if it is inferior to the region by one - quite a bit in terms of average expected profit and more than 1 billion in terms of the maximum possible one. Further, already after the bootstrap, which, if possible, excluded random elements, it became clear that region 2 is the only one, the probability of which is less than 2.5%, and there are no negative values in the 95% confidence interval. Accordingly, guided by these considerations, I would opt for **region 2**, which always shows the only non-negative results for all negative indicators."
